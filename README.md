Github
Introduction:
Greetings! My name is Lindsay Voglewede and I graduated as an Electrical and Computer Engineer (ECE) at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). I created this GitHub to address some of the work that I did during my degree and things that I learned aside from college. During the 6 months after I graduated, I took a non-related ECE job and go over things that I’ve missed or needed to refresh. 
Coming soon; I will upload code on C, C++, html, javascript, C/C++ oriented towards the MSP432 IT Launchpad and word documents containing information about labs for my classes.
